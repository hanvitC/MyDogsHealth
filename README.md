# MyDogsHealth
This is my first Java program I created using OOP!
This console-run program provides recommendations on which dog food product you should buy for your dog, as well as which date is the best date to go for a walk 
with your dog.

In addition to providing 50 different recommendataions on best dog food for your dog based based on their size, age, health conditions, and food allergies, 
the program also analyzes the weathers of the next two weeks with respect to the temperature, and humidity, and returns the calculated result of which date and time to 
walk your dog according to your availibility. 

To run the application, run `MyDogsHealth.java` and `WhenToWalk.java`.
